C library for approximately bash-compatible pattern matching.
Supports the following features:

 - The '*' wildcard, which matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
 - The '?' wildcard, which matches exactly one character.
 - Brace syntax for alternatives, such that {foo,bar,bat} matches any of
   foo, bar, or bat. Braces can also contain other braces and wildcards.
 - Escaping any of the above special characters by preceding it with a '\'.

If you have cloned the git repository, then you should first run ./autogen.sh
to generate the configure script.

If you have unpacked the source code from a tarball, then you can just follow
the standard 'configure; make; make install' recipe to install the library.
